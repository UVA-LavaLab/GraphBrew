# bench/ — C++ Benchmark Suite

GAPBS-based graph algorithm benchmarks with pluggable reordering.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `src/` | Benchmark drivers (one per algorithm: `pr.cc`, `bfs.cc`, `sssp.cc`, …) |
| `src_sim/` | Cache-simulation variants of the same benchmarks |
| `include/` | All headers — GAPBS runtime, external libraries, GraphBrew extensions |
| `bin/` | Compiled binaries (generated by `make`) |

## Building

```bash
make -j$(nproc)        # Build all benchmarks
make bin/pr            # Build just PageRank
make clean && make     # Full rebuild
```

## Usage

```bash
bench/bin/pr -f graph.sg -o 9:fast -n 5    # PageRank with GOrder fast, 5 trials
bench/bin/bfs -f graph.sg -o 12:leiden      # BFS with GraphBrewOrder
```
